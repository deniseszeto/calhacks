<b>The actual TITLE of our project is:</b>                                      <br/>
    Food Hax                                                                    <br/>

<b>Purpose:</b>                                                                 <br/>
    There come times when we chefs want to make something completely new.       <br/>
    This web application allows you to explore random recipes and indulge on unforeseen adventures! <br/>
<br/>
    _This application is for anyone who cooks!_

**Key Features:**

> 1. Use keywords to find a random recipe! The output is not deterministic!

> 2. Shows you the best place to buy ingredients based on your location and recipe.

> 3. If you need cooking tools, simply input a list (e.g. wok, pot) and the app converts the list into a cart! (Walmart, Amazon)
